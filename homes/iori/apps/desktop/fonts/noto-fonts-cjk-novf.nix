          Noto ${typeface} CJK is a ${lib.toLower typeface} typeface designed as
          an intermediate style between the modern and traditional. It is
          intended to be a multi-purpose digital font for user interface
          designs, digital content, reading on laptops, mobile devices, and
          electronic books. Noto ${typeface} CJK comprehensively covers
          Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean in a
          unified font family. It supports regional variants of ideographic
          characters for each of the four languages. In addition, it supports
          Japanese kana, vertical forms, and variant characters (itaiji); it
          supports Korean hangeul — both contemporary and archaic.
